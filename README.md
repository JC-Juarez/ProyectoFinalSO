# ProyectoFinalSO
Operative Systems Final Project


This Project allows to simulate the Functionality of Two Scheduling Algorithms for OS. 

<!>The Following Program recreates FIFO and LRU Page Replacement Algorithms.
<!>How to Run the Program
Step 1 - Execute the Program in a C++ IDE
Step 2 - A Menu Option will appear. The program will generate a Random Stream of Processes, then you can select which Algorithm to perform; Enter 1 for FIFO, Enter 2 for LRU. After selecting the Algorithm the number of Fails and Efficiency will be given.
Step 3 - If you wish to exit, Enter 3.
